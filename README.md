### About My Blog 关于我的博客

There are two blogs:

- [rayray.moe](https://rayray.moe) where my daily and chemistry-relevant posts will deposit.
- [tkaray.github.io/tkaray](https://tkaray.github.io/tkaray/) (**Current**) where posts some technical infos. Although I'm a noob on CS.

### Why launch a GitHub Blog 为什么要开这个博客

Because after depression on my experimental life on inorganic chemistry, I found that there are dozens of interesting things which people around me don't understand. Experiments aren't everything, so does Ph.D.
