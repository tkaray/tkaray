### About My Blog 关于我的博客

There are two blogs:

- [rayray.moe](https://rayray.moe) where my daily and chemistry-relevant posts will deposit.
- [tkaray.github.io/tkaray](https://tkaray.github.io/tkaray/) (**Current**) where posts some technical infos. Although I'm a noob on CS.

### Why launch a GitHub Blog 为什么要开这个博客

Because after depression on my experimental life on inorganic chemistry, I found that there are dozens of interesting things which people around me don't understand. Experiments aren't everything, so does Ph.D.

If I learn chemistry until dead, I will learn to regret my life. Afterwards, I start to learn to use many tools which isn't chemical needed. Why not go further, and learn to use front-end techs? 

I want to solve the problem mentioned upwards: Why chemistry research is so low-efficient (or only my project)? I love chemistry (so does computer science), but the problems trouble me for a long time, and I want to give a solution.

If these techs will help me get a job, I am glad to bring up the solution with help of information technologies, where it may lies on.

> **It CANNOT be solved by the classical methods, but the technology revolution will.**
