This is Ray's _after-hours-technical_ site.
For daily messages && blogs, I have another blog named <a href="https://rayray.moe" target="_blank">落雨星影</a>.

Everything which is not suitable for daily blogs will be deposited on this site, and useful resources shared or originally-developed will be duplicated deposited.


### About My Blog 关于我的博客

There are two blogs:

- [rayray.moe](https://rayray.moe) where my daily and chemistry-relevant posts will deposit.
- [tkaray.github.io/tkaray](https://tkaray.github.io/tkaray/) (**Current**) where posts some technical infos. Although I'm a noob on CS.

### Why launch a GitHub Blog 为什么要开这个博客

Because after depression on my experimental life on inorganic chemistry, I found that there are dozens of interesting things which people around me don't understand. Experiments aren't everything, so does Ph.D.

If I learn chemistry until dead, I will learn to regret my life. Afterwards, I start to learn to use many tools which isn't chemical needed. Why not go further, and learn to use front-end techs? 

I want to solve the problem mentioned upwards: Why chemistry research is so low-efficient (or only my project)? I love chemistry (so does computer science), but the problems trouble me for a long time, and I want to give a solution.


你好，这里是 Ray。虽然是无机化学专业，但是还是很喜欢折腾有意思的东西。
如果有什么能够帮助的，这里有最快的方式。

<a href="https://www.zhihu.com/people/feng-rui-82-22" target="_blank">My Zhihu Account 目前只在用知乎 </a>

The planned discussions include:
- Chemical Softwares
- Front-End Learning
- Interface, Experience Design
- Project Design, Develop and Deploy
- Everything maybe useful/interesting for you & me


Wish you have a good day!

Build with ❤ and 🕊 from 21,03,2020.
