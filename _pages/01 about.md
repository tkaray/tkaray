This is Ray's _after-hours-technical_ site.

Useful resources shared or originally-developed will be repost here after well-organised.

你好, 这里是 Ray. 虽然是无机化学专业, 但是还是很喜欢折腾有意思的东西.

### About My Blog 关于我的博客

There are two blogs:

- [Memories of the Starry Sky](https://rayray.moe) where my daily and chemistry-relevant posts will deposit.
- [Night Voyager](https://tkaray.github.io/tkaray/) (**Current**) where posts some technical infos and collated contents. Although I'm a noob on CS.

### Why launch a GitHub Blog 为什么要开这个博客

After depression on my experimental life on inorganic chemistry, I found that there are dozens of interesting things which people around me don't understand. Experiments aren't everything, so does Ph.D.

I want to solve the problem mentioned upwards: Why chemistry research is so low-efficient (or only my project)? I love chemistry (so does computer science), but the problems trouble me for a long time, and I want to give a solution.

Wish you have a good day!
